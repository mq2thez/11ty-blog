Hi, I'm Ben Sangster.

I can also be found [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sangster).

I currently work at [Etsy](https://etsy.com) on the Web Platform team, which means that I spend a lot of time thinking about how Etsy's Javascript tooling infrastructure and how to make our developers more effective.

I have previously worked for [Classy](https://www.classy.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), and for some smaller companies.

I've never been very good about spending time writing and publishing, but I'm trying to get better about that.
